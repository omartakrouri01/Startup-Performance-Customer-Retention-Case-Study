# Startup-Performance-Customer-Retention-Case-Study
A B2B cosmetics startup engaged me to analyze merchant performance across two sales channels — B2B (wholesale) and drop shipping — with a central strategic goal: go deeper with existing customers rather than prioritizing acquisition. The company set a target of 10 customers placing at least one order per day. I built a KPI-driven Power BI dashboard, performed churn and purchase-frequency analysis, and ran a feasibility study on an educational content initiative. My analysis uncovered the channel most likely to hit the target and produced recommendations that prevented an expensive, high-risk initiative.
